My name is Joel (pronounced /xo'el/) and I am passionate about leveraging computational tools and data to address complex biological challenges.

🌱 During my PhD, I explored how plants adapt their genomic expression in response to environmental changes.

🤖 In 2020, I was a Health Data Science fellow at Insight Data Science, where I developed SuppSmart, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based recommendation engine. This system suggests dietary supplements based on user queries, utilizing a dataset I curated from various online sources. I built the application by training a word2vec model from the ground up. Explore the repository [here](https://github.com/rodriguezmDNA/suppsmart).

🫐 I subsequently joined Foodome/Naring Health, focusing on identifying natural compounds in plants that could potentially treat diseases through a Network Medicine approach. The company was later [aquired by by Viome.Inc.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/viome-acquires-naring-health-to-further-its-lead-in-personalized-nutrition-and-longevity-301975499.html)

🧪 Currently, I am at Freenome, contributing to the development of innovative non-invasive tests for early cancer detection.
