My name is Joel ([xoˈel]) and I love using computers and data to solve biological problems.

During my PhD my research focused in understanding how plants regulate their genomes in response to their environment.

As a Health Data Science fellow at Insight Data Science. There I created `SuppSmart`, a recommendation system to suggest dietary supplements based on an user’s search query. I mined data from the Internet to create my own dataset and build an app by training a `word2vec` model from scratch.

I worked at Foodome/Naring Health, helping build tools to prioritize natural compounds in plants that could be beneficial to treat diseases in the context of a Network Medicine. The company was later [aquired by by Viome.Inc.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/viome-acquires-naring-health-to-further-its-lead-in-personalized-nutrition-and-longevity-301975499.html)

Now I'm working at Freenome, helping develop assays for early cancer detection.
