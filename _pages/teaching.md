# BIS 23B (Spring 2020) at UC Davis

Co-developed a curriculum and taught an honors course in principles of bioinformatics using R for more than 30 students over two academic quarters.
Deployed [course materials](https://bookdown.org/joelrome88/bis23b/) for free in bookdown format with an appendix on data visualization.

As part of the course I also co-lead the writing of a small publication with the students. We added 16 new strains of halophilic prokaryotes to a microbiology genome database. [Link to article](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/71775904/e01540-19.full-libre.pdf).
