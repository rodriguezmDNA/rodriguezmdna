## BIS 23B (Spring 2020) at UC Davis

I collaborated in developing and delivering an honors bioinformatics course using R, engaging over 30 students. We made the course materials publicly available in Bookdown format, which also includes a detailed appendix on data visualization. Access the materials [here](https://bookdown.org/joelrome88/bis23b/) for free in bookdown format with an appendix on data visualization.

Additionally, I co-led a student collaboration that resulted in a publication, contributing 16 new strains of halophilic prokaryotes to a microbiology genome database. Read the publication [here](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/71775904/e01540-19.full-libre.pdf).
